Program 1 prints "Hello" 2 times
Program 2 prints "Hello" 1 time in parent process

The differences is because stdout is line-buffered when it points to a terminal. 

In program 1, the fist print has no newline. 
At the time of fork() both memory spaces have the same content. 
Therefore, in program 1, both parent and child processes print "Hello".
